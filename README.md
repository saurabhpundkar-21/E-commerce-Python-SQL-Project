# saurabhpundkar-21-E-commerce-Python-SQL-Project

# Objective
The objective of the project is to analyze e-commerce sales data to identify top-performing product categories, understand customer behavior, and evaluate year-over-year sales growth. Based on these insights, the project aims to optimize the product portfolio, develop targeted marketing strategies, and recommend actions to drive revenue growth and improve customer engagement.

# Some Key Insights
• The e-commerce platform serves customers from 4,119 distinct cities, showcasing a wide 
  geographic reach.
• A total of 45,101 orders were placed in 2017
• An overwhelming 99.9981% of orders were placed using the installment payment option.
  Customers prefer flexible payment methods. Offering installment options is a key driver of 
  purchases, and introducing promotional schemes on installment payments can boost sales.
  Monthly Order Trends
  Highest Orders: January 2018 (7,269 orders) and March 2018 (7,211 orders).
  Lowest Orders: September 2018 (16 orders) and October 2018 (4 orders).
  The significant drop in orders in September and October suggests either operational issues 
  (e.g., supply chain disruptions) or customer disengagement during those months. Investigate 
  the cause and implement targeted campaigns or promotions for similar periods in the future.

• Seller ID: 7c67e144b00f6e99d305cea6b0101ab generated the highest revenue of 507,166.91.

• Steady Sales Growth
  2016: Total sales were ₹59,362.34, indicating an initial low market penetration or 
  operational 
  startup phase.
  2017: Sales rose significantly to ₹7,249,746.73, marking a massive growth rate.
  Insight: This dramatic increase suggests effective strategies like market expansion, improved 
  product offerings, or increased customer acquisition.
  2018: Sales further increased to ₹8,699,763.05.
  Growth has continued but at a slower pace compared to 2016–2017, possibly due to 
  market maturity or saturation.
  
• Padre Carvalho ranks highest with an average of 7 orders per customer, followed by:
  Celso Ramos: 6.5 orders.
  Cândido Godói and Datas: 6 orders each.
  These cities demonstrate a higher frequency of orders, indicating either:
  A loyal customer base.
  A smaller customer pool with frequent repeat purchases.

• Top-Performing Categories
  Bed, Table, and Bath: The highest sales of ₹1,712,553.67, showcasing strong demand in home 
  essentials.
  Furniture and Decoration: Ranked second with ₹1,430,176.39, indicating that home decor and 
  furniture are popular among customers.
  Perfumery: Secured third place with ₹506,738.66, emphasizing consistent interest in luxury 
  and personal care products.
  Insight: These categories are key revenue drivers and could benefit from inventory expansion, 
  targeted marketing, or bundle offers to boost sales further.

  ## Recommendations
• Boost High-Performing Categories:

• Expand Product Offerings: Introduce more variations, special collections, or bundled deals in 
  Bed, Table, and Bath, and Furniture and Decoration to capitalize on their strong performance.
  Enhance Marketing for Perfumery: Invest in targeted advertising and premium branding 
  strategies for the Perfumery category.
  Revitalize Moderate-Performing Categories:

• Run Targeted Campaigns: Focus on increasing sales in Telephony and Fashion Bags through 
  seasonal discounts, influencer partnerships, and tailored advertising.
  Diversify Product Range: Add new styles or technologies in Telephony and Fashion Bags and 
  Accessories to attract a wider audience.
  Reassess or Discontinue Low-Performing Categories:

• Analyze Sales Trends: Review customer feedback and sales data for categories like Insurance 
  and Services, Fashion Children’s Clothing, and CDs, Music, and DVDs to determine if these 
  products are still relevant.
  Consider Phasing Out: If the categories consistently show poor performance, consider reducing 
  inventory or discontinuing them altogether to focus on more profitable areas.
  Leverage City-Level Insights:

• Target High-Performing Cities: Cities like Padre Carvalho and Celso Ramos with high average 
  orders should be prioritized for loyalty programs, exclusive offers, or personalized 
  promotions.
  Engage Smaller Cities: For cities with lower order averages, consider promotional offers, 
  localized marketing, or improving delivery services to increase engagement.
  Optimize Year-over-Year Growth:

• Continue Expanding: Given the healthy growth from 2017 to 2018, continue efforts to build on 
  the success of the top categories.
  Sustain Growth in Home Products: As home-related products are dominating sales, introducing 
  new trends or seasonal variations could continue the upward growth trend.
